I am going to post this for two reasons.
One: Brightening the mood.
Two: I feel like it...

This is a recreation of what I did in the past. This isn't perfect and it won't be, but it's close enough...to me....
Also, all the levels besides the 5th are possible. I was looking for that staircase .dif file. And 6th level's start text isn't appropriate but it was for my personal use. I bet my thoughts were the big ship.

Bare Minimum:
All six levels, and interiors MBP and Other.
For extra effect, put the 0 through 24, Colon, Period and Slash into the numbers file and the music file in sounds.
Additionally, use the MBP Beginner background for the levels.

I just wanted to have a mod where I can work at my own pace again. Sooner or later, another pack of 6 will be released. 
This pack will have:
Purple Moving Platform level in time.
Thrill Ride, and the go for the green/skate park/motto marblecross hybrid.
Haunt level.
Intermediate New Level 1.
Huge TubeTwist world area level.
Tunnel Vision level.
