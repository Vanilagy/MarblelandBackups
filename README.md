# Marbleland backups

This repository serves as a backup for most of the data available on [Marbleland](https://github.com/Vanilagy/Marbleland). All of the levels are backed up into the `levels` directory. In addition, metadata about levels and packs is stored in `missions.json` and `packs.json`, which are basically direct dumps of the Marbleland database with any sensitive data removed.

The backups are done automatically on a 24-hour basis.
